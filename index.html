                      I'm currently a research engineer working on prediction for self driving cars at Uber ATG. I love reading papers so hopefully this blog will serve as a good medium for me to 
                      document my thoughts. I also like doing Putnam and TopCoder problems in my spare time (although I'm not very good at it) so you'll occasionally find posts about algorithms or 
                      mathematics. You'll also find random posts about Physics and Dota2.

                        <h3>Variational Autoencoder</h3>
                        <p>
The following article summarizes and reimplements the paper by Kingma and Welling. The paper combines the traditional variational Bayes with neural networks. In particular, instead of the intractably approach by tradiational variational Bayes, the paper proposes an approach to estimate the variational lower bound using neural networks. In order for gradient descent to work, the paper introduce the <b>reparameterization trick</b> which pushes the stochastic operation of sampling out to the input, thus enabling the gradient to flow through the networks.

                        <h3>Capsule Network</h3>
                        <p>
The following article summarizes and reimplements the Capsule Network paper by Sara Sabour, Nicholas Frosst and Geoffrey Hinton. The paper is well-motivated: There is no concept of entities in current neural network architectures, there is no explicit concept of agreements in high dimensional activations. The authors propose forming a group of neurons into capsules outputing a vector instead of one single activation. The hope is that each capsule will represent an "entity". The authors propose an algorithm (dynamic routing between capsules) to formalize the ideas of high dimensional aggreement (certain entities tend to go appear together).

                        <h3>Reinforcement Learning 1: The Grid World</h3>
                        <p> In this short post, I want to give an introduction to the problem statement and characteristics of reinforcement learning as well as implement some basic techniques to solve grid world. This is chapter 1 of a series of posts about modern reinforcement learning techniques.

                        <h3>Reinforcement Learning 2: Solving CartPole</h3>
                        <p> The following post is inspired by a request for research from <a href="https://openai.com/requests-for-research/#cartpole">OpenAI</a>. The CartPole environment requires training an agent who can balance a 1 dimensional pole on a moving cart. The simplicity of the problem allows very fast iteration on ideas and experiments. In this post, I will extend OpenAI's request for research by implementing and comparing a broader range of algorithms. The post will cover random method, hill climbing and policy gradient as suggested in the request. In addition, I will also cover black box optimization method such as CEM and ES as well as tree search method such as MCTS. </p>.
